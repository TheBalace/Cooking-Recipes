    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>Whole Wheat Buns</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Patty</li>
    <li>Toppings of your Choice</li>
    <li>Sauces</li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season both sides of the patties generously with salt and pepper, ensuring even coverage.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on the preheated grill or skillet and cook for approximately 4-5 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or longer to your desired level of doneness. Avoid pressing down on the patties with a spatula, as this can cause the juices to escape, resulting in a drier burger.</li>
        <li>While the patties cook, toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a separate skillet until they're lightly golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Adding cheese, place a slice of your favorite cheese on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking, allowing it to melt slightly.</li>
        <li>Assemble your burgers by placing the cooked patties on the bottom half of the toasted hamburger buns. Add your desired toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise.</li>
    </ol>
